# ProjectHachathon(HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MongoDB)

This project was completed within a 24-hour window during the Hackathon Hack2Impact, which was sponsored by Huawei.

SAGA (Search And Get Answered) is an online platform specifically designed to assist students and staff of Al Akhawayyn University (AUI) in finding any information related to the university and student life. Rather than wasting time checking multiple websites, brochures, or booklets, users can quickly and easily obtain the information they need by searching for keywords or asking questions.

The platform provides a centralized hub for accessing a wide range of information, including academic and administrative resources, campus events and activities, and general university-related information. SAGA's search functionality is powered by advanced algorithms that analyze and rank the relevance of the information retrieved based on user queries.

Overall, SAGA streamlines the information search process, saving users time and effort while ensuring they have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information available.

# SAGA includes three sections:
| Section | Purpose |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Home** | This is the home page of the website, which contains our search engine. When the user input something in the search bar, the search function retrieves the most relevant pages from the MongoDB database and displays them in order of relevance. |
| **Admin** | While regular users are only allowed to fetch data in the home page, the admin page provides an interface for modifying, deleting or adding new data (new cards). It is only accessible by authorized users, such as website administrators, and faculty members. |
| **About** | The about page contains information about SAGA's mission and objectives. |
