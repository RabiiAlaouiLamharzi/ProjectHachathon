**Problems to Fix:**

There may be issues with the navigation bar items on the index.html page at the moment.

When attempting to access admin.html, a login form will appear requesting the following information:

- Username: r.lamharzialaoui@aui.ma
- Password: rabii2001

If you encounter difficulties accessing admin.html, you can try accessing it directly via the following URL: https://rabiialaouilamharzi.github.io/ProjectHachathon/admin.html

Maybe that the issue with admin.html has to do with deploying the website on Github?

There are still some problems related to mobile display!
